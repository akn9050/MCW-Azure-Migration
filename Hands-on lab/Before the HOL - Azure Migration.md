    4.  From the **All locations** drop down, select the location where you will deploy the lab.
    5.  From the last drop-down, select **Show all**.
    6.  Check that the selected quotas have sufficient unused capacity:
        - Standard DSv3 Family vCPUs: **at least 8 vCPUs**.

## Before the hands-on lab

Duration: 60 minutes

You should follow all steps provided *before* performing the Hands-on lab.

### Task 1: Deploy the on-premises environment

1.  Deploy the template **SmartHotelHost.json** to a new resource group. This template deploys a virtual machine running nested Hyper-V, with 4 nested VMs. This comprises the 'on-premises' environment which you will assess and migrate during this lab.

    **NOTE:** The template will take around 6-7 minutes to deploy. Once template deployment is complete, several additional scripts are executed to bootstrap the lab environment. **Allow at least 1 hour from the start of template deployment for the scripts to run.**

### Task 2: Verify the on-premises environment

1.  Navigate to the **SmartHotelHost** VM that was deployed by the template in the previous step.
   
2.  Make a note of the public IP address.

3.  Open a browser window, and navigate to **http://\<ip-address\>**. You should see the SmartHotel application, which is running as nested VMs within Hyper-V on the SmartHotelHost.
